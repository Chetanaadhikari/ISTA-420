Lesson Plan 9

1. What does a set operator do?
Set operators are operators that combine rows from two query result sets.

2. What are the general requirements of a set operator?
a. The two input queries must produce results with the same number of columns. 
b. Corresponding columns must have compatible data types. 

3. What is a Venn Diagram? 
A Venn diagram is also known as a set diagram. It is a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of 
different sets.

4. Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION operator. What does it do?
The UNION operator unifies the results of two input queries. 

5. Draw a Venn Diagram of the UNION ALL operator. What does it do?
The UNION ALL operator unifies the two input query results without attempting to remove duplicates from the result. 

6. Draw a Venn Diagram of the INTERSECT operator. What does it do?
The INTERSECT operator returns only the rows that are common to the results of the two input queries. 

8. Draw a Venn Diagram of the EXCEPT operator. What does it do?
The EXCEPT operator returns only distinct rows that appear in the first set but not the second. 

10. What is the precedence of the set operators?
The precedence of the set operators is the INTERSECT operator precedes UNION and EXCEPT, and UNION 
and EXCEPT are evaluated in order of appearance.
