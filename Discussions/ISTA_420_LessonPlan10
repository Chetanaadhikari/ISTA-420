1.	What is a window function?

A window function is a function that, for each row, computes a scalar result value based on a calculation against a subset of the rows from the underlying query. 

2.	What does PARTITION do?

PARTITION restricts the window to the subset of rows that have the same values in the partitioning columns as in the current row.

3.	What does ORDER BY do?

The SQL ORDER BY clause is used to sort the data in ascending or descending order, based on one or more columns.

4.  What does ROWS BETWEEN do?

ROWS BETWEEN  filters a frame, or a subset, of rows from the window partition between the two specified delimiters.

5.	What is a ranking window function? Why would you use it? 
             
You use ranking window functions to rank each row with respect to others in the window.

6.	What is an offset window function? Why would you use it? 

Offset window functions is used to return an element from a row that is at a certain offset from the current row or at the beginning or end of a window frame. T-SQL supports two pairs of offset functions: LAG and LEAD, and FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE. 

7.	What do LEAD and LAG DO?

The LAG function looks before the current row, and the LEAD function looks ahead. 

8.	What do FIRST VALUE and LAST VALUE do?

You use the FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE functions to return an element from the first and last rows in the window frame, respectively. 

9.	What is an aggregate window function? Why would you use it? 

You use aggregate window functions to aggregate the rows in the defined window. They support window-partition, window-order, and window-frame clauses

10.	What is a pivot table and what does it do?
A pivot table is a program tool that allows you to reorganize and summarize selected columns and rows of data in a spreadsheet or database table to obtain a desired report. A pivot table doesn't actually change the spreadsheet or database itself.
